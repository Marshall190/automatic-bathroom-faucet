<h2>How to install automatic bathroom faucet</h2>
What You'll Need
Before getting started, make sure you have all of the tools and materials necessary for the job. Here is a list of what you should have on hand before beginning the installation process:

•	Automatic bathroom faucet (Choose one that matches your existing plumbing setup)
•	Screwdriver
•	Plumber’s tape
•	Adjustable wrench or pipe wrench 
•	Pipe cutter or hacksaw

Installing Your Faucet
Now that you have gathered all of your supplies, it’s time to get started. Follow these steps for a successful installation: 

1. Shut off the water supply by turning off shutoff valves located under the sink. If there are no shutoff valves, turn off the main water supply valve in the house. 

2. Unscrew and remove any old hardware from around the sink area, including handles and other components. 

3. Clean out any debris in the mounting hole; if needed, use a small brush or cloth to get rid of dirt and grime buildup. 

4. Wrap plumber’s tape around threads on new faucet components before attaching them to pipes in case there are any leaks due to improper tightening. 

5. Use an adjustable wrench or pipe wrench to attach new components securely -- hand tighten only; do not overtighten as this can result in damage to parts or pipes!  

6. Turn back on the water supply and test out the new faucet by running water from it; check for proper flow rate and temperature settings before declaring installation complete!  

7. Finally, attach handle(s) if applicable – most automatic bathroom faucets come with handles included but some require separate purchase/installation – just follow manufacturer's instructions for proper attachment/installation procedure here too! 
8 tips for successful installation:
•	Check the instructions before beginning; make sure you understand all of the steps.
•	Make sure to turn off the water supply before starting any work.
•	Use plumber’s tape on every connection for a tight seal. 
•	Be careful not to overtighten any connections; this can cause damage to the pipes or parts.
•	If the faucet requires a handle, make sure to attach it and test it out before declaring the installation complete.
•	Check for leaks by running water from the new faucet and making sure there are no drips or puddles forming around the base. 
•	It may be helpful to draw a diagram of the installation process for reference during reassembly, if necessary.
•	If you are unsure about any part of the installation process, don’t hesitate to consult an experienced plumber or other professional.

Your new automatic bathroom faucet should be installed correctly and ready for use. Enjoy the convenience of automated water flow without ever having to turn a handle!
